# User Management

## Overview
This repo contains a tutorial showing the iterative steps going from a base backbone user management SPA to a full-blown deployable application. The base application was obtained from a video on [backbonetutorials.com](http://backbonetutorials.com) called 'Backbone.js Beginner Video Tutorial'.  In this video [Thomas Davis](http://thomasdav.is) does a great job creating a basic backbone user management application.  This application contains the create, read, update and delete (CRUD) functionality with calls to an actual API endpoint.  If you are new to Backbone, I would recommend stepping through this video to get the core application that this tutorial starts with.  If you would just like to begin stepping through this tutorial, the finished product from the video for the user-management application (`index.html`) can be found in a folder called `workspace` located off of the root folder.

## Installation
No special installation instructions needed to run the basic application.  Just clone the repo to your local.

## Tutorial
The tutorial for this repo can be found here [tutorial.md](./tutorial.md).
