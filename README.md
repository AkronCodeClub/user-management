# User Management

## Overview
This repo contains a tutorial showing the iterative steps going from a base backbone user management SPA to a full-blown deployable application. The base application was obtained from a video on [backbonetutorials.com](backbonetutorials.com) called 'Backbone.js Beginner Video Tutorial'.  In this video [Thomas Davis](thomasdav.is) does a great job creating a basic backbone user management application.  This application contains the create, read, update and delete (CRUD) functionality with calls to an actual API endpoint.  If you are new to Backbone, I would recommend stepping through this video to get the core application that this tutorial starts with.  If you would just like to begin stepping through this tutorial, a finished user-management can be found in the root folder.

## Installation
No special installation instructions needed to run the basic application.  Just clone the repo to your local.

## Tutorial
The tutorial for this repo can be found here [tutorial.md](./tutorial.md).
