## Overview
This tutorial was put in place to grow a base backbone application to a ready to deploy Single Page Application (SPA).  It starts with a basic backbone.js application with CRUD functionality that uses templates.  It builds on the application built by [Thomas Davis](thomasdav.is) in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZSjvWtUxYk) and incrementally adds features. There is an `index.html` file at the root of this repo.  It is the finished product from this video.  If this is all new to you, I encourage you to follow along with the video and build the application yourself.  If you already have some basic backbone.js understanding and want to move forward with this tutorial then you can use the base application provided here.

The process of building up a deployable application includes making the source code maintainable, testing the code, making the end product performant, and minification of the finished product.  A number of JavaScript libraries exist to help achieve these goals. One library, [Grunt](gruntjs.com), exists to aid a developer in building such a product by providing a means for defining and executing tasks.  As you go through each step in the tutorial you will learn about new libraries and what services they provide.  You will also learn how to setup Grunt tasks to make the use of these libraries transparent to other deveopers.  This tutorial is designed so that you can go through each step start to finish or jump to a single step if you are looking for something specific.  Each step in this tutorial is built on the previous step.  The source code is broken down into sub-directories of the form `1-Name of Step`, `2-Name of next step`, etc.  This allows you to see the incremental steps taken to get to the finished product.  It also allows you to compare the source code with the previous steps.

I hope you find this tutorial helps you with your JavaScript product development workflow.
